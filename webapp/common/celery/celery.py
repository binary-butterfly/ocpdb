    Celery extension for Flask applications.

    Involves a hack to allow views and tests importing the celery instance from extensions.py to access the regular
    Celery instance methods. This is done by subclassing celery.Celery and overwriting celery._state._register_app()
    with a lambda/function that does nothing at all.

    That way, on the first super() in this class' __init__(), all of the required instance objects are initialized, but
    the Celery application is not registered. This class will be initialized in extensions.py but at that moment the
    Flask application is not yet available.

    Then, once the Flask application is available, this class' init_app() method will be called, with the Flask
    application as an argument. init_app() will again call celery.Celery.__init__() but this time with the
    celery._state._register_app() restored to its original functionality. in init_app() the actual Celery application is
    initialized like normal.
